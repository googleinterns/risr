/cynthia-m/step/pull/2#pullrequestreview-421845874,2020-06-01T13:34:05Z,gradywardgoogle,"Hey Cynthia,

Great work on this first pull request. I really appreciate that you've gone beyond the basic requirements, and added some cool functionality to your site!

Overall feedback: think about maintainability. Try to build your stylesheets and javascript in a way that won't need updating if you change the number of pictures you're displaying, or the order of elements on the page. Name variables a little more explicitly so that it will be easier to come back to this code and update it in the future.

I left a lot of feedback because we're here to learn, but this is a great start, and please ping me when you've resolved these comments and I'll take another look. Sorry to have toaken so long on this initial review!

/cynthia-m/step/pull/2#discussion_r433238433,2020-06-01T13:38:00Z,gradywardgoogle,"A more canonical way to do this is to create a class called ""hidden"", and have this style for it:

.hidden {
  display: none;
}

Then you can toggle it's visibility by adding or removing the hidden class.

In general we try to avoid setting style directly on Document Object Model (DOM) elements, happy to discuss more any time."

A more resilient way of doing this would be to make a class ""profesh"" which you've already done, and use a for loop to iterate over all elements returned by document.getElementsByClassName. That way if you add or remove a profesh link, you won't have to add another line to your javascript!"

1) whitespace should be used to separate semantically distinct blocks. Line 3 currently does that, but line 9 does not (the closing tag has the most relation to the block above.
2) whitespace should only be used to separate when it gives you concrete value. If you've got 2-5 distinct blocks separated by whitespace, that makes it clearer. If you've got a high ratio of whitespace to non-whitespace, that doesn't.
3) The most frequent cases of whitespace making sense are _between_ tags, very rarely would you want whitespace at the beginning or end of a tag"

1) grouping related properties (font.*, margin.*, top|left|bottom|right, etc)
2) Having a consistent ordering of properties between blocks (if you have position categories at the top in one, do it for all)
3) Using the same color format across the board (rgba is a great choice)
4) always have space between the colon and the property value
5) add semicolons to the end of every line, including the last one (this will make it easier to add properties in the future."

So in this doPost method, we should unpack the data and store the data in datastore.

/Wseawright/My-STEP-Portfolio/pull/6#discussion_r438423664,2020-06-10T21:40:13Z,weiwong-g,It seems like errors could be mistakenly reported as no files uploaded. Although I am not sure how errors are handled for uploads. So this comment is just meant to help you think about error handling.  In many cases it's tempting to use default (zero/empty) to assume no action. But we need to be careful to distinguish the cases where failure causes the default value to be returned. So it might be worth use a non-default value for zero/empty. Or we need to be explicit handling errors.

The comment itself is not going to protect incorrect use of this method (Say, if frontend is developed by another person).  So it's will be a good idea to check and make sure a user is indeed logged in. If not, at least write a log entry. Or even provide some error message back to frontend.  (Perhaps you did check to make sure user is logged in last time my my comment may have caused you to change the code. Sorry for the confusion)."

/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435502322,2020-06-04T19:34:47Z,scottymb,"Fix indentation of this closing tag, too."
/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435502765,2020-06-04T19:35:40Z,scottymb,Keep styling in CSS rather than inline in HTML. It's nice to keep these separated whenever you can.

/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435503879,2020-06-04T19:37:48Z,scottymb,"I'd remove this `br` tag - if you're looking to get more space between the h2 and p, consider adding extra margin in CSS, either to the bottom of h2, or the top of p."
/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435504930,2020-06-04T19:39:48Z,scottymb,"Similar comment here - in general, I almost never use `br`, and only do in a couple cases where it's definitely appropriate, like a mailing address. What you have here is a new paragraph, so instead of these, close your existing paragraph and start a new one. When you've done that, I recommend putting it on a new line of code, too, so it's nicer to read the file."
/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435505761,2020-06-04T19:41:22Z,scottymb,"In general, I'd suggest removing a lot of the extra blank lines in here. Not all, but I try to use them when it helps make a clean logical grouping and when it helps visually break up a large chunk of text. And when using them, stick to one. That will make the final file feel tighter for people looking at it later."
/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435506883,2020-06-04T19:43:21Z,scottymb,"In JavaScript, stick to 80 characters per line.

However, whenever I was struggling to resize the image in CSS and keep its proportions without turning it into a background image, so the HTML option seemed to be my only way to go. Do you have any recommendations?"
/jalenjenkins/step/pull/1#discussion_r435996709,2020-06-05T15:27:45Z,scottymb,That's interesting - the style tag should be identical to adding those same styles in CSS. Maybe we could look at the specifics at some point and I can help debug.

But instead of using print statments, let's throw an exception (perhaps an IllegalArgumentException here). In general, we want to code _defensively_, which means we want to fail requests that are poorly formed, or don't conform to our expectations. Throwing an exception is a good way to indicate that to the calling user (whether that's Javscript that you write, or an accessor of your API)."

Secondly, I noticed that you referenced the HTML style guide but since the function is a JavaScript function should I not be following style guide for that?

/denzilbilson-google/my-portfolio/pull/1#pullrequestreview-419704375,2020-05-28T00:44:58Z,peap,"Just a quick comment about commit messages. You can see how github (and other interfaces) display the first line of the commit message like an email subject line, so it's useful to make that first line of the message a good summary of what the commit does. (vs. your 859655a commit, which starts with a bulleted list and thus has an implied summary of ""-change title to reflect user"", which only partially describes the commit.

A better message for that commit messages would be something like:

> Make the requested changes from PR #1 
>
> The changes were:
> - thing one
> - thing two
> ...

It's not a really meaningful change, and probably happened inadvertently when they got opened in some editor and possibly re-saved. That happens all the time.

However, we should avoid including changes in a commit that don't contribute to the purpose of the commit. Concretely, in cases like this, if I noticed an unexpected file in the list of files that git shows me when writing a commit comment, I would cancel the commit process, revert the unnecessary changes, and then start the commit process again. In fact, my usual workflow is usually to review a full diff of my workspace compared to the last commit before I initiate a commit, so that I can ensure I'm only committing what I intend.

It's not a huge difference in this case, so I'll leave it up to you whether you want to add back the newline to these files in a future commit in this branch. "

Why do you have a post request that only seems to define the request count and then a get request that produces the result? It is the get request that should tell the server how many comments are requested in which case there would be no need for class variable.

I think we can probably still make this a little simpler though. For one, you've got a bunch of code for setting the text on the `factContainer` mixed in with your logic for choosing a fact, so I think it would be nice if you could split them up. I suggest a helper function, something like `chooseRandomFact()` that just returns the chosen fact and then update the UI with that value.

Also it seems like your function takes in the `prev` argument but then also breaks out of its scope to refer to the `last` variable. You probably don't need both and I think it just makes your code harder to follow. You might even want to just use the actual value in the UI as your `last` variable.

I also think it might be even simpler and have less indirection if you just compare the `fact`s themselves for equality rather than doing all the bookkeeping with the indices. Integer comparison would be more efficient than String matching but I think we should focus on simplicity and readability here."
/talvarez0507/my-portfolio/pull/1#discussion_r433288045,2020-06-01T15:02:29Z,talvarez0507,I made several helper functions to split the logic and implemented your suggestion for getting rid of the 'prev' variable.

```
function addRandomFact() {
  const fact = getNewRandomFact();
  setFactText(fact);
}
```

Then there would be a clean separation between each step. I think it should be possible and it'll be much easier to follow. All this branching is about choosing the right fact to use next, so you should be able to isolate it all into a function by itself."

Optional has methods like `.ifPresent(...)` that let you do something with the value inside, or you can explicitly check with `.isPresent()` and then call `.get()`.

Also a nit/style/personal preference thing, you can rearrange this statement to look like this:

```
String commentString = (String) entity.getProperty(tblComment);
String name = (String) entity.getProperty(tblName);
long id = entity.getKey().getId();

Comment comment = new Comment(id, commentString, name);
comments.add(comment);

1) Put all images into a single folder and read the folder to determine the number of images in the folder. Also, you don't need to fix the prefix to ""lagos-"". You might be able to get the file name directly.
2) If the option 1 is too difficult, you can put a file close to the folder of images, and add the hardcode value there. Or you can extract the hardcode value to the top of this file. In this way, people don't need to scroll down the file to find the hardcode value when they need to modify it in the future."

/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434559969,2020-06-03T13:19:49Z,KushalD1999,I am a bit confused here. I was wondering what do you mean by the untrusted user content? Some type of script entered in the comment section that can harm the application as well as datastore on cloud? or untrusted inappropriate comments?

/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434560695,2020-06-03T13:20:52Z,KushalD1999,right. I missed it
/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434561200,2020-06-03T13:21:40Z,KushalD1999,I have added the delete button in the next commit so this code is being used now.
/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434733748,2020-06-03T17:25:00Z,mctavish,"jsdoc is similar to javadoc.  The styleguide wants it on virtually all code, but I think that a reasonable compromise is to put it on the more public aspects of the interface.

https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#jsdoc"
/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434734555,2020-06-03T17:26:24Z,mctavish,"(seriously, do document the units for timestamps.  I can't count the number of bugs I've found and created related to this sort of oversight)"
/KushalD1999/step/pull/8#discussion_r434739911,2020-06-03T17:35:37Z,mctavish,"Untrusted from a security perspective.  There are a few ways that accepting user content can be risky, and the risk is inflated when you surface one user's input to another user's browser.  For example, a potential attack path would be that a user leaves a comment that contains a script that installs a keylogger.  Each person that visits the page and views the comment would then have their browser compromised (within the scope of that website).

It looks like there's some scrubbing happening (probably through the gson serialization) that prevents some of the obvious injection which is good.

Again, no action needed here, but I just wanted to raise the idea that any time that you allow a user to either store data in your system or to show their content to another user, there are risks that are good to keep in mind."
/KushalD1999/step/pull/9#pullrequestreview-424730987,2020-06-04T18:41:23Z,mctavish,"Looks pretty good as a first step.

The general rule for client/server interaction is to *never* trust the client.  In the case of auth, it's normally achieved by requiring the user to sign into the client, and then passing a token along with requests (such as adding a comment) which the server can then validate.  For AppEngine, I believe that the token bit is managed behind the scenes for you, so checking whether the UserService believes that the user is logged in before accepting mutating operations should suffice.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about this!"
/KushalD1999/step/pull/9#discussion_r435473266,2020-06-04T18:41:23Z,mctavish,This is better achieved by adding/removing a class.
/KushalD1999/step/pull/9#discussion_r435473973,2020-06-04T18:42:13Z,mctavish,It's nice to provide the user with an indication of which account they've used to sign in with.

/KushalD1999/step/pull/9#discussion_r435486071,2020-06-04T19:02:42Z,KushalD1999,I will change this. It will only allow users to delete the comment while they are signed in

The problem is that it only allows to hide button for one of the top comment (the last added comment) even though i am using classes for comments.

If there's a specific commit on that you just need to bring over, then you can get the commit id from that branch (after seeing `git log`) and then `git cherry-pick $commit_id` on this branch. We can walk over how to do that in person tomorrow, if you like; cherry-pick is useful to know but there are some subtleties and pitfalls.

* use nth child instead of alt1 and alt2 as class names

Returning a negative value when you can't parse is fine, but if the user sends a negative value, there's no reason this method should check for that.

This is called a ""helper method"" (or sometimes a ""private helper method""). You don't want to put too much logic in here and as much as possible leave the actual ""decisions"" to the callsites. In this case, right here in this method we don't care if the input value is -1 (it will parse correctly), but if it is and you also return -1 in the error state, a caller can't tell the difference."

/andrewseamanco/STEP_tech_trainings/pull/12#discussion_r436223502,2020-06-06T01:14:34Z,tambchop,"It's probably not the most efficient solution, network traffic wise, to:
1) request that all comments be sent from the server to the browser, and..
2) send N individual deletion requests from the browser to the server.  (where N is the total number of comments)

That process results in N + 1 total requests, and it also involves the server sending the actual text content of all comments to the browser, which doesn't need it in this case.

There are a lot of potential ways to reduce the number of over-the-network service calls that need to be made:
- You could add another parameter to your delete-comment endpoint called something like ""shouldDeleteAll"" which is just a boolean, and if that is set, you ignore the ""id"" parameter and just delete all comments.  This way, you wouldn't need to fetch all comments in the first place.. so only one total call to the server =o
- You could change the ""id"" parameter to ""ids"" and let it be an array.. the con here is that you would still need to fetch all of the comments initially to get all of the ids.  But two total calls to the server isn't terrible.

There's another way.. possibly the most correct way, but it involves a deeper understanding of web API design, and I doubt that the tutorials mean for you to have to learn web practices to this depth, but I thought I'd share it as I only vaguely remembered it myself and think it's an interesting thing to know / could be useful later:
I think most web server APIs support a few more methods in addition to GET and POST.  The others are PUT (or PATCH) and DELETE.

The idea is that for something like comments, you would send a GET request to ""/comments"" when you want to retrieve one or more comments, you'd send a POST request to ""/comments"" when you want to create a new comment (like you're doing now), you'd send a PUT request to ""/comments"" when you want to update or edit a comment, and you'd send a DELETE request to ""/comments"" when you want to delete one or more comments.  It's kind of cool... notice how all of the requests are sent to the exact same URL path i.e. ""/comments"", but the method type dictates which action should be taken.

And Java servlets support this.  You can override the doDelete method to implement the DELETE action =o

Anyway, I want to emphasize that I'm not an expert on this stuff and that nothing I'm suggesting is definitively the ""right"" answer.  More than anything, I think the best thing to consider from what I've said is the very first part, which is that it would probably be best to save network traffic by not having to send N requests to the server when what you really want to do is telling it to delete ""all"" of the comments =)  However you would like to go about that is up to you!

I left a giant comment about web API endpoint design philosophy which I *definitely* don't expect you to explore in depth.

Also, considering that you have another variable for the URL to go to after logging *in*, and that URL is the exact same, maybe consider just consider creating a class constant:
private static final String ROOT_URL = ""/"";

and just using that same constant in both places, since it seems like in both cases you want to go back to the root/home page."

And also I believe all lowercase is preferred (and hyphens, if there are multiple words).  I see you have other URLs/endpoints that are in all lowercase already.. I would probably lowercase ""/login"" as well unless you had a specific reason to break from the general conventions (that I think exist..)."

The reason I don't just store them in the first place is that every time the comments page is refreshed it needs to pull the entities from the datastore to be up-to-date with all the latest comments, including those from other users. A possible solution would be to aggregate new comments to a stored list of comments, but that entire list would have to be compared to the list of comments being pulled from the database, at which point the servlet may as well just return the data pulled from the database instead of needing to compare it with stored data first.

- me.html is an empty file - was this committed intentionally?
- Generally the node_modules folder is not committed to git. Instead, the README has instructions for setup (including npm install package.json or whatnot). But I'll ignore it since this is just a project for the week. However, if you are only using a single file of bulma, maybe only commit that one?
- Can you clarify whether bulma is only for CSS, or if it's for some JS dependencies as well?
- I'm not sure I'm running your project correctly. If there are things I need to do, can you put them in the README? I'm running a HTTP server at portfolio/src/main/webapp/ and I see the website but JS doesn't seem to work - for example, clicking on the hamburger button does nothing, which makes it hard to review the header and links to social media, which this PR adds :)"

/irisliu77/STEP/pull/9#discussion_r434961332,2020-06-04T02:45:26Z,anbenson,"So the code here feels a bit strange - you have an Entity object, deconstruct it into its parts, then put it back together again to add to the ArrayList. Why not add it right away?

But stepping back for a second - the code on line 54 turns the Entity object (which you don't know the internals of, it being from a 3rd party library) into JSON instead of turning a format you have control over (such as the Comment class you presumably are using in your other PR). This makes it so that your JavaScript below is forced to examine internal properties of the object which could change if the Entity library decided to change, which is brittle.

In summary, I would advise against serializing the Entity object directly to JSON. You can use the Comment object now, or since the only thing your JS uses is the content property, you can just serialize an ArrayList<String> of the content properties.

Let me know if this is confusing."

I recommend against the Array.prototype.forEach pattern - it's inverted, so it's harder to read at first glance than a for-of loop (I know I keep bringing for-of loops up, but it was created to fix all the problems with forEach, for-in, and for (let i = 0; i < ...)), and it's harder to debug since it takes in a function as an argument so you can't step directly into it in the JS debugger."

Generally we want to try to avoid ""magic numbers"" (""arbitrary numerical constant. In other words, a random number that ""just works"" or ""looks right"" without a grounded explanation"") as much as possible unless they are absolutely necessary. It looks like your drop down to change the amount of visible comments is not doing anything at the moment, could that issue possibly be related here? If so, how could we take both pagination and the max number of comments a user wants to see at one time into consideration?"
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436152787,2020-06-05T20:37:13Z,nicorod-google,"Am I right in assuming the intent here is to see if there are too few comments on the page such that further pagination on the next button would not result in any new comments? If so, does that need to be dependent on the magic number ""5""? "
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436154484,2020-06-05T20:41:29Z,nicorod-google,"I just want to make sure I properly understand your intent here. Say we have 10 total comments. 
Would that  mean the intent is to have 3 total pages, the first two pages with 5 comments each and the last page with the ""No comments to display"" text?
Or is the intent for the ""No comments to display"" text to only appear when we have 0 total comments, such that in this same example if we have 10 comments it would only be 2 total pages and the next page button is disabled on the second page?"
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436218456,2020-06-06T00:41:41Z,lxcyqx,"the 5 and 4 are used to calculate which comments to load onto the page. For example, if the currPage = 0 (we are on the first page of comments) then we would have for (int i = 0; i<=4;i++) and index into the arraylist of comments to pull up the correct comments to display. Similarly, if we are on currPage = 1 (second page of comments) then the for loop would be for (int i = 5; i<=9; i++). Should I store 5 and 4 as a constant instead? Also the drop down does limit the number of comments. So for example, if you limit to 5 comments, and then you click the next button, there wouldn't be any comments to show. I don't think the dropdown is very necessary in terms of user experience given that I have added pagination, but it was mentioned in the walkthrough so I left it in there"
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436232217,2020-06-06T03:10:28Z,lxcyqx,"I think I had a different understanding on the functionality of the dropdown. I was thinking that it would limit the total number of comments. However, I have no changed it so that the dropdown acts as a way to set how many comments are displayed per page."
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436232282,2020-06-06T03:11:07Z,lxcyqx,Yes that was the intent. I have now changed it so that it takes in a variable (storing the number of comments the user wants to display per page)
/lxcyqx/step/pull/10#discussion_r436233020,2020-06-06T03:22:39Z,lxcyqx,"It's the first scenario that you brought up. What I have now is that if there are 10 comments, then on the second page the next button would still be enabled so if you click next then it would bring you to a page saying ""No comments to be displayed."" This would not happen if there were 9 comments. In that case there would only be a total of 2 pages. 

To handle the case in which there are a total of, say, 10 comments and you are displaying 5 comments per page. That means when you are on the second page, the next button would still be enabled because the javascript does not know that we are currently on the last page. I check to see if something is the last page by checking if the current page has fewer than the max number of comments that is able to be displayed per page. The reason javascript does not know that it's on the last page is that in the Dataservlet I query the data and use limit and offset to get the necessary data and then store that in an arraylist of comments and then return the comments. Thus, the javascript does not know how many total comments there are because the java is only returning a limited number of comments. I considered perhaps just returning a list of all the comments, and then display the appropriate ones on the javascript side. However, that would mean lots of unnecessary Comment objects are being created and stored in the arraylist on the java side. I am not sure how to get the total number of comments while also making sure that I'm not creating and storing comment information that I won't really be using because it slows down the loading of each page.

UPDATE: I found a way to fix all of this. So now it should reflect the second case you mentioned. 10 comments should only have a total of 2 pages and the next button is disabled on the last page"

Generally speaking, I'm not sure you should store binary files in git. They will significantly slow down repo cloning. For now, it's fine, since you don't want any dependencies, and there's not yet a GCP project in which to store them, but I thought I should mention it. Also, you should probably compress these jpegs-- they're super large, and will be slow to download! You can use Photoshop or ImageMagick to do that.

Also I feel like there's a bit of boiler-plate repetition here, since you're using static html and not a web-app or templating framework. That may be an issue with the original assignment though-- can you link me to it?"

A few notes:

Lines (even HTML, where possible) are supposed to be <= 80 characters, and things like  spans should probably be on new lines, like in [this example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38268573/how-to-print-each-letter-in-different-color-in-css-html/38268759).

I strongly prefer css selectors using classes over ids, so for future reference, perhaps this would be better:

```
<style>
  .google-logo .blue {
    color: #4285F4;
  }

  .google-logo .red {
    color: #DB4437;
  }

  .google-logo .yellow {
    color: #F4B400;
  }

  .google-logo .green {
    color: #0F9D58;
  }
</style>

<span class=""google-logo""><span class=""blue"">G</span><span class=""red"">o</span><span class=""yellow"">o</span><span class=""blue"">g</span><span class=""green"">l</span><span class=""red"">e</span></span>
```

We could even set up [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) compilation later so the style would be less redundant: 

```
.google-logo {
  .blue {
    color: #4285F4;
  }

  .red {
    color: #DB4437;
  }

  .yellow {
    color: #F4B400;
  }

  .green {
    color: #0F9D58;
  }
}
``` 
but, sadly, [Google's brand guidelines](https://www.google.com/permissions/logos-trademarks/) don't permit using it in a phrase, so I guess you should remove the coloration. :'(

That being said, `body1` isn't a very descriptive name.

I think that we might be mixing up our CSS a little much, and it will only get more complex as we add more. Really you need a `style.css` that contains styles that are used across pages. For styles that apply to just one page, it is a little cleaner to break them out into their own file `aboutme.css` or, though it violates the ""separation of concerns"" in the style guide, just have page-specific css in the page itself. I guess to play it safe with the style guide, a separate file is better."

The good thing: Thank you for not using a table for layout. :)

Thing to improve: Many old CSS layout libraries (e.g. Bootstrap) use copious amounts of nested divs.

This is NOT something you need to change right now. But it's something you should look into for your capstone later:

Look into 'display: grid'

This allows you to specify up front how your layout should look, and then you can focus on just writing the actual content divs, rather than having to mess with nested row/column divs. So if you write CSS that changes the layout based on device width, your html doesn't need to be aware of that.

There's even a way to visually represent it in your CSS (see grid-template-areas). Your html will thank you for it, and it will free you to build nice responsive HTML without needing to address the layout as part of your HTML structure."

/kathleen-lund/step/pull/2#discussion_r432086816,2020-05-28T19:56:37Z,tzsebe,"For this kind of thing, you should separate logic from data. No need for anything fancy, but I'd say, split your pre-populated blog posts into an array of objects, and then loop over the array and run the code below.

Also, you might want to wrap this logic into a function, and have that function be invoked once the document fully loads (is it an onload event or somesuch?) This is so that you guarantee that when this Javascript runs, the document elements are fully created, so you don't get any weird failures caused by race conditions."
/kathleen-lund/step/pull/2#discussion_r432090279,2020-05-28T20:00:53Z,tzsebe,"Should we be deleting the element here? Like, doesn't setting the innerHTML just make the element empty, without deleting it (meaning you now have an empty post in your list of posts), rather than actually deleting it?

I might be wrong about how this works - you can check it with your browser's 'inspect' functionlity.

Basically, if you have:

```
<section id=""blog-posts"">
  <article id=""blog-post-1"">
    blah blah blah

  <article id=""blog-post-2"">
    blah blah blah

  <article id=""blog-post-3"">
    blah blah blah
  </article>
</section>

/kathleen-lund/step/pull/5#discussion_r437569109,2020-06-09T16:38:19Z,tzsebe,"Oh my goodness! I just learned something about JavaScript: There doesn't seem to be a proper date formatting utility! This is kind of a shock. Most languages offer a basic thing that effectively gives you access to `strftime` (standard system call to format time), but at least according to [this site](https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-date-in-javascript/#formatting-a-date), there isn't such a utility.

If it were me, I'd either go with one of the pre-determined ones (e.g. `toLocaleString`) or do something similar to what you're doing here. I believe the format you're using happens to exactly match `toLocaleString` so you'd be better off using that, rather than re-inventing the wheel here.

If you did want to customize your time formatting, my main advice would be to take the code to do that and move it into its own function, so that all parts of the page can benefit from it (e.g. if you have a blog post with some comments, the timestamp on the blog post and the timestamps on the comments could use the same formatting).

... but again, in your case, I'd just keep it simple and go with `toLocaleString`.

Also, if you want to better understand why Javascript's lack of support is so shocking to me, you should really watch [this short Tom Scott video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY)."
/kathleen-lund/step/pull/5#discussion_r437600182,2020-06-09T17:30:16Z,tzsebe,"Nice job on taking the initiative to add pagination! And apologies in advance for the super-long feedback comment here.

If I'm reading your code right, what you're basically doing is:
* Always returning ALL comments on the backend
* Loading ALL comments on the frontend, and displaying only a portion, based on state variables you maintain

As you can imagine, the more comments you have, the slower the page will be.

One very quick fix is to only load the comments once, and then have the pagination buttons just use the data you've already loaded... then you can provide a refresh button (and refresh any time a comment is added), and you're set!

... that kind of thing would be sufficient if you knew you'd only ever get like 100 comments total, and limited it to 100 on the backend side. If what I'm about to describe below is not doable, or too much work, then just set a max number of comments to load and try not to reload it with every click on the page.

.... Now... Imagine you have millions, or hundreds of millions of comments. Popular youtube videos, as an example, have high hundreds of thousands to millions of comments. So, it goes without saying that loading all of them would be intractable.

## A General Explanation (actual thing you can/should do linked below):

The more standard way that pagination is solved is by making the backend API support pagination. A request into a backend API that supports pagination might look like:

```
REQUEST:
{
    // ... all the fields needed for the request, like if it's comments
    // on a post, there'd be a postId. This is not relevant here...

    // Pagination-specific stuff.
    pageSize: 50,
    pageToken: <discussed below>
}
```

The response would look like what's below. It's basically what you have now (a list of comments), but wrapped into a response object that includes some pagination specifics.

```
RESPONSE:
{
    // What you already have.
    comments: [ <comment1>, <comment2>, ...]

    // Pagination stuff.
    nextPageToken: ""abcd1234...whatever""
}
```

When you first call the API when your page loads, you would just pass it a page size, and leave `pageToken` blank. Then, when it's time to load the next page, you would call the API again, except this time, you would pass in the `nextPageToken` as a `pageToken`, so it knows where to start. If there is no `nextPageToken` returned, you know there's no more pages.

In the backend, you need to make it so it doesn't load every comment. In the backend, you would need it to load only the tokens that belong on the next page.

For this to work, your data store needs to support indexing (say by timestamp). So, let's say your `pageToken` is ""timestamp + comment ID"". Then, you could query for comments greater than or equal the timestamp, and start ""counting"" only when you found the comment ID in question.

Then, you'd load up one more comment than your page size (so pageSize = 50 means you load up 51 total), but instead of returning that 51st comment, you convert it into a nextPageToken (grab its timestamp and ID and send it as the next page token). Then, when the user clicks, the next request will know where to begin.

There are a bunch of nuances I'm glazing over, like what happens when comments are deleted or things change. This is too complex to address in an overly-long code review comment already. :-)

The downside of this approach is that implementing ""prev"" is quite difficult... though the good news is, when dealing with unbounded things like comments, you don't usually need it, and you end up with something like facebook or youtube, where you just keep loading more. There ARE ways to do ""prev"" with this approach, but they're a bit more painful.

## What AppEngine datastore recommends you do

Turns out AppEngine's DataStore you're using has this functionality built in already:

https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/queries#cursors_limits_and_offsets

This includes some example code for achieving the result. It looks like it makes you return its internal cursor directly to the frontend, which has its own intricacies, but I believe you should be able to make this work with relative ease."

`getParameter(request, /* fieldName= */ potato).orElse(""watermelon"");`, which I think reads pretty clearly. I also generally like exposing the Optional in case you want to do more complicated manipulations with it in the future. 

Maybe the better question though is why you even want to allow default values. Do you want to support comments without a name? Or a comment body? I could maybe see an argument for anonymous comments, but not sure what use empty ones are. "

In Google's[ sample code](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/blob/2e5996c68440134a79f1511c57529fa5cf987628/appengine-java8/datastore/src/test/java/com/example/appengine/QueriesTest.java) they initialized it only once and reused it for unit tests, so I will move the call outside of the doPost."
/shainachen/my-portfolio/pull/5#discussion_r437788072,2020-06-10T00:04:57Z,shainachen,"Right now to address this, I'm structuring it as two separate classes where Comment class has variables ""name"" and ""comment"" plus standard access to those 2 variables. Since there are multiple ""Comment"" entities, and the query gets all of them, I have an additional Comments class where it handles the queries/addingComments by having methods like getComments that returns a List<Comment> and inside does the querying in these lines you've highlighted and creates Comment instances. Does this sound like a sensible structure or does it feel like it may be over complicated? I think there is use to both (ex. sometimes I just want to create a single comment, other times for queries, the Comment class wouldn't take away the string literal ""comment"" from here)"

/shainachen/my-portfolio/pull/5#discussion_r438292183,2020-06-10T17:28:26Z,NathanBricault,Optional: a nice way to do this is with an ImmutableList (https://guava.dev/releases/23.0/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableList.html) - you add each element to a list builder then build the result when your're done to produce the list.
/shainachen/my-portfolio/pull/5#discussion_r438295038,2020-06-10T17:33:05Z,NathanBricault,A potentially cleaner way of doing this so you don't need the break logic: get a stream from the iterable and limit the number of entries (something like `.asIterable().stream().limit(numComments).foreach(appropriate lambda function))`

2) You generally use these when you have literal values - when the value is derived from variables it's easier to tell where it came from so they tend to be more noise than helpful."

1) You don't necessarily have to go this route, but the best way I am familiar with of handling value classes in java is with Autovalue (https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value). This basically takes care of the gritty work of dealing with equals and hashcode in a sensible way, and generating setters/getters. 
2) If you do want to stick with the hand-rolled approach, I would lean towards have the value class itself be something like UserComment which stores the name and test, and then has a toEntity method for when you actually want the entity. "

It might cause the website to get out of sync if for example the marker wasn't successfully stored in the server. 

The server should always be the source of truth. After you send a marker to store in the server, you should also fetch the markers again from the server (for example, a call to fetchMarkers). This way you make sure that the markers displayed on your page are actually always the ones stored on the server.

In general, I tend to prefer smaller, isolated changes. Here's a discussion on the benefits of doing so: https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html

Our internal code review tool has some pretty good support for doing this with separate branches that depend on each other, but it looks like git / GitHub [doesn't](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26619478). This is probably something we'll have to spend a bit of time to figure out. For now feel free to just add dependent commits to the same branch, and just keep the individual commits tiny, as that will still let us keep our code reviews focused.

If you have some totally independent commits, go ahead and make a new branch so you have can a separate PR."

getRandomFact() returns a random fact

I guess you don't want to patch the following commits into this PR.

For actually submitting a PR, you need to merge the PR (branch) into master branch after we approve.

If you want to start a new change, you need to create a new PR (branch). A PR should be a self-contained change.

Thanks,

1) var displayedFunFact
2) var unusedFunFact

Then, you don't need all the if/else if/else condition

When user want a random Greeting
1) Check if len(unusedFunFact) == 0 --> return that all entries are used
2) get a fun fact using unusedFunFact --> can avoid getting repeat values
3) After you get a fun fact, remove the fun fact from unusedFunFact and add it to displayedFunFact.

There are different way to generate the fun fact, but just giving a rough idea.

Overall very creative way to generate fun facts! (was also very cool to play around with the website)

/smarquez-jpg/my-portfolio/pull/3#discussion_r438951358,2020-06-11T17:29:25Z,peizhaoou,"In Java, everything is a reference. For example, ""value"" variable here is a reference to a String object, and Java provides two types of equality comparison:
(1) checking if the reference is null, meaning whether the reference is pointing to any object. Your ""value == null"" is doing this;
(2) checking if the object referenced by a variable is indeed equal to the content of a given object, where you would use something like ""value.equals("""")"", which says if the object referenced by variable ""value"" actually equals to the empty String object.

In this case, I think you should use the second one since the caller always passes """" to defaultValue, meaning that it always points to some object (i.e., value is never null here)."

This makes it easier and nicer to read and is a good habit to get into (at Google, all lines are broken off at 100 characters).

There might be a way to set up a rule in your IDE so it shows a line at the 125 character mark while you're coding (like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29968499/vertical-rulers-in-visual-studio-code)."

/laptou/step/pull/14#discussion_r434256698,2020-06-03T01:13:32Z,laptou,"Using an IIFE when it is not necessary seems like an equally bad, if not worse, solution than adding ESLint disable comments to me. It is significantly more verbose and will puzzle someone reading this code in the future. I could put a comment next to it that says ""this is to get rid of the ESLint error"", but then why can't I just use a comment to get rid of the ESLint error?

Finally, using callbacks to handle the Promise will lead to control flow becoming more complicated when I add more stuff to this event handler (for example, showing a toast notification, which I also plan to implement using Promises).

I think that adding ESLint disable comments is fine as long as I have gone out of my way to address all of the pitfalls that ESLint is trying to warn me about: in this case, floating promises are bad because weird things will happen if an error escapes from this promise. However, I have wrapped all functions that might throw errors in `try`/`catch`, so it feels safe to disable the lint.

What do you think?"

I could work around that on the client side, but this seemed like a more robust solution because it also makes it easy for me to do server-side validation (in a future PR I take advantage of this by truncating comment text at 50000 bytes, which I could not do if I was not handling the bytes directly. If I did not do this, it would make it pretty trivial for someone to DDoS my app)."

/laptou/step/pull/14#discussion_r434716351,2020-06-03T16:55:16Z,geekster777,"These are fair points. As a general rule, you shouldn't ever need to disable a linter error when you own the code end to end. In our codebase, the vast majority of disabled lint errors exist to access private or undocumented members of a class whose code we can't refactor (normally external dependencies). The rest exist to interop with code that doesn't follow our style guides.

Disabling linter errors tends to be symptomatic of code that could be formatted better. As you mentioned, using an IIFE would reduce readability. I agree. The proper way to handle this, and to handle large callback blocks in general, is to make them their own functions instead of using large anonymous functions:
```
async function fetchComments(form) {
  ...
}

...

form.addEventListener('submit', () => {
  void fetchComments(form);

This way you cannot drag any of the images off of the page to save them and everything can be sized easily. I redid the way these were organized in the latest version, also."
/hannahsalameh/step/pull/5#issuecomment-635519149,2020-05-28T18:27:06Z,hannahsalameh,sorry for the weird commits I'm still figuring out how to use github branches!
/hannahsalameh/step/pull/5#discussion_r432068339,2020-05-28T19:26:30Z,devonwasson,"okay, here comes a somewhat lengthy comment. 

I understand what you're going for here with initializing these variable. if you initialize them once, you don't have to do ""var"" before the variable name when you go to overwrite them below. Additionally, they'll technically exist so, if somehow a user manages to pass an ID that doesn't match any of the IDs you're accounting for in your if/else cases, the lists will exist and things won't crash. 

_However_, things will fall apart when page_heading[0] and page_heading[1] are called. Let's say that my clickedId was ""devon"" which is not one of the ones you test for. in that case, page_heading will just be an empty list. So calling page_heading[0] will result in an error (because there is nothing inside the list). 

There are a few ways around this. The first is to check that page_heading[0] exists before calling page_heading[0] (so something like if (page_heading.length > 1 { do page_heading[0] and page_heading[1]}) but that might be more complicated than it needs to be. The second option is to avoid using lists at all. Lists are great for when we have an unknown quantity of things or if we want to iterate over a bunch of things. Considering we are always adding a constant number of strings to these lists and never iterating over them, we would be better off just having separate variables for the two strings in each list. For example, here, we can do:

var page_heading = """";
var page_heading_desc = """";

and then just change those four variables explicitly. This way, we are being more descriptive with our naming AND we get the benefit of not crashing if we never change those values (because they're already set to empty strings). 

img_ids_desc is a little more tricky because you DO end up iterating over it, but considering it is a list of lists, the sub lists have the same problem as above. That being said, the way to fix this is to use some sort of named container (object, hash map, struct (i dont think js has structs though... maybe it does) to hold those items in the sub list and then put those named containers in a list and iterate that way, but that's complicated and out of scope here so I would say img_ids_desc is fine as is, especially because you won't crash if nothing is added to it.

/hannahsalameh/step/pull/11#discussion_r434062132,2020-06-02T17:50:12Z,devonwasson,"If i understand your goal here correctly, you want to fetch the limit sent by the request and, if there is a valid option, use that value to get results. otherwise, default to 10. there are a few things we could change here that would make for better code:

- the way this is right now, you'll sometimes make two calls to results.asList. We can ensure we only ever make one call by rearranging things. If we get rid of the first assignment for limitedResults and move it to an else case below the if, we'll only ever make the call once. However, we're now rewriting essentially the same line twice, just with a different param. So what if, instead, we changed the logic that happens in our if/else to change the value of numQueries? Something like if (numQueries == -1) {numQueries = 10;} and then call results.asList afterwards with the numQueries param.

- the default value of 10 is not clear. This is what we call a ""magic number"" because we don't document this anywhere. It's often a good idea to name constants. that is, we can introduce a variable like ""default_limit"", assign it to 10, and then use that variable in the code rather than directly using the number 10

- Defaulting to 10 is fine but the way we do it could use some work. If we have a value of -1, we want to change that value to 10. but why -1? the getLimit function is lacking documentation that says we return -1 on error so someone calling the function would have no idea that's an option without reading code. So we can do one of a few things. We can add documentation and call it a day.  We can not return -1 and let the caller handle negative values. Or, we can throw an error when we get an unexpected value (and document that we throw this error). That way, if a value is truly incorrect, we force the caller to handle getting bad numbers. This prevents the caller from making mistakes as errors need to be handled or else the program will crash. So if this function throws an error (like IllegalArgumentException) and the caller needs to catch that error if it happens and handle accordingly (like using a default value)."

You can also check out the following example:

If you prefer, I think it would be okay to keep things are they are, and update the code later to use async/await. However, I think you should address the comment above about removing the console logging before merging."

There are four different [access level modifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html) for instance members:

1. `public`
2. `private`
3. `protected`
4. package-private

If you don't specify one of the first three, the instance member becomes package-private, which means that other classes in the same package (`com.google.sps.servlets` as defined at the top of the file) can access the member.

In general, it's safest to keep the raw field completely private and expose methods which other classes can interact with which modify the field. That way, any invariants / assumptions you have about the field are maintained by the class containing it."

No, sorry. I may have put my comment in a weird spot. Basically your first line should be a summary. If you have a small commit, the summary may be sufficient to describe what you did and you can call it good.

If you have a large commit, then it's a good idea to list out what's included in it. Sorry for the confusion.

I am always highly suspicious of building HTML/SQL/etc in strings. It tends to be quite fragile and difficult to determine if you actually got it right. One potential option is to move the template of what you want into a separate data file. Then you read it in at runtime (and probably cache it), and do whatever value filling you need then.

Another strategy is to embed the template in your code as a string variable somewhere. That way, the whole template is in 1 variable together, and you still do interpolation of your values later."

Part of software design is separating your application into layers. This Word class would be part of the model layer: it represents a Word in the flashcard application with the word in english, the destination language code, and the translated text. The model should be separated from the application's business logic i.e. how it interacts with the models. 

I would consider the translation to be part of the application's business logic and so I'd recommend pulling it out to the caller. So you could would 

```
String translatedWord = translate.transate(....)
Word word = new Word(""Hello"", ""ru"", translatedWord)

/eash130/step/pull/4#discussion_r433209499,2020-06-01T12:39:09Z,eash130,41 is for the loop to end so that it runs 40 times. 20 is the halfway point of the iterations at which I show the text so that the animation doesn't occur after the text shows up. I randomly chose it as such so that it doesn't run for too long while also keeping the animation relatively smooth.

also, it's okay that 40 and 20 are arbitrary, but define a constant (numLoops or similar) and use that instead. (numLoops +1, numLoops/2, etc). otherwise it's confusing to the reader what these numbers mean."

/RCAVelez/step/pull/3#discussion_r432154346,2020-05-28T22:15:31Z,mecolmg,"Consider giving class names or ids to these elements rather than using the HTML tag name in your code, with an exception for the ""base styles"" of your page (i.e. use a particular font by default, remove underlines for all links, etc.). 

Class names or ids that are short and descriptive act as self-documentation for code, and are more performant to use as accessors than relying on child accessors. For the selectors you have below consider something like:
- `nav` --> `#nav`
- `nav ul` --> `.navLinks`
- `nav ul li` --> `.navLinkContainer`

It's more preferable to have media breakpoints like you've defined below for different device sizes. You could then easily define this padding should be 16px on desktop, 8px on tablet, and 4px on mobile or something like that."
/RCAVelez/step/pull/3#discussion_r432157408,2020-05-28T22:23:56Z,mecolmg,Woah... This is some crazy math for a font. Consider just using media breakpoints for the same reasons listed above on `vw`. 
/RCAVelez/step/pull/3#discussion_r432158114,2020-05-28T22:25:52Z,mecolmg,Can you explain the usage of display table here? What is it accomplishing?

Also, it's preferable to just use `flex: 1;` here as it will intelligently set the other values for `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`. Also recommended by the styleguide to use shorthand properties whenever possible: https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Shorthand_Properties"

Just one minor comment about naming. Most css class names in the PR seems very general. For example .left .right, .light, .dark these naming don't completely explain what they do, but a rule is created for each of these selectors. You could either use a namespaced naming pattern like timeline-left, timeline-right, section-dark, section-light, or you can make the rules more specific by selecting with more classes, such as .timeline.left, .timeline.right, .section.dark, .section.light.

1) Please don't abbreviate words in method naming, use generateRandomFact() instead.
2) General suggestion no immediate fix required - While hovering on the button, the hover animation looks great, but since the height becomes different due to the additional border, the whole page is pushed down a little bit. This feels unintended. Most web designs generally prefer local animation effect not to affect the whole page structure.
Adding a default transparent border or adding a fixed height container might help, but up to you for the fix :) "

/hadleyshapland/step-portfolio/pull/1#pullrequestreview-418794467,2020-05-27T01:18:19Z,ghandre,"Looks good! Minor nit on indentation.
+1 to Jerry's suggestion on more descriptive names; A good habit is to bulletize the changes you're making when you send out the pull request (maybe even describing which files they map to, if that's not obvious), that way reviewers have a better idea in what order to read things.

I think you already merged in this pull (which is fine). No need to create a new change just to fix the indentation."

/hadleyshapland/step-portfolio/pull/2#discussion_r431389035,2020-05-27T19:22:19Z,ghandre,"The sidebar seems to be duplicated in each file.

In general, we want to avoid duplication since it increases maintenance burdens and is highly error prone (someone editing the code later on will have to find and edit all the copies correctly, but will often mess one up without noticing; Over time this gets compounded and leads to systems that are impossible to work with).

It will be a bit more challenging, but could you find a way to share this logic between files? There's several ways to go about it, traditionally one would use an iframe, but now (html5) the simplest approach is probably a link/rel. My personal preference would be to create this in a script (and then share the script), using dom manipulation to build the nav programatically (though this isn't usually how most sites do it).

You should find how to do this with a search like ""include html from another file"", but also check out w3schools dom manipulation totorial if you're interested in the latter approach.

If you'd like to work on this in a seperate pull that's fine."

If you would prefer to include the delete method in the same servlet, there is an HTTP method called DELETE which is intended for requests that delete resources. Instead using a POST request in your javascript, you could change that to a DELETE request and then implement a doDelete method within this servlet.

for reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#doDelete(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse)

If you're interested in a bit more of a challenge/learning exercise (one which is quite relevant to day to day work we do with server programming), one catch to the above is the race condition you'd get if two people try to vote at the same time:
- Suppose the count for some country is 5;
- User A votes, which would cause your servlet to read the value 5, and increment it to 6
- But before it has a chance to write the result (6) to the datastore, User B votes.
- User B still sees the old value 5 in datastore, and increments its copy to 6.
- Now A writes storing 6 in the datastore
- Now B writes, storing 6 in the datastore again

This can happen because the servlet is multithreaded. Here's a video explaining the problem and the ""synchronized"" term in java:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH7G-N2pa8M
If marking the doPost method as synchronized doesn't work, a synchronized block might work instead."

Just a remark (no action required) if you were deploying this publicly, I would also suggest adding checks that the regions voted on are valid (e.g.: you could pre-populate in datastore all allowed regions with a vote-count of 0, and disallow adding new ones); At present, a malicious user could randomly generate billions of regions, and bring down your service by overloading datastore / making your webpage responses be huge (thus soaking up all your bandwidth);

Potentially, they might also be able to insert malicious code into the region name, and have that run on other users' computers (though I'd hope the google API you use has its own layer of checks for that, so this may not be feasible). This is also solved by having preset regions users can vote on (but there's also a whole area of libraries dedicated to sanitizing/rejecting this kind of abusive input from users)."

However, you've taken on the complexity of asynchronous behavior into your error reporting.

/FluffyPenguin/step-training/pull/4#discussion_r433360448,2020-06-01T16:51:50Z,FluffyPenguin,I think I named the numComments variable poorly. It should be the maximum number of comments that the user wants from the server which is why I am breaking the for loop once the comments array has the max number of comments from the query. Will rename numComments to maxNumComments.

1) js scripts
2) regular text

For the purpose of code health, I'd refactor the code in this:

const funFactsJsIds = [
    'fun-fact-sister',
    'fun-fact-selfie',
];

const funFactsStrings = [
    'I\'m a fan of collections. I collect postcards, stickers, books, snacks, etc.',
    'blahblah',
]

const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * (funFactsJsIds.length + funFactsStrings.length));

if (index < funFactsJsIds.length) {
   funFactContainer.innerHTML = document.getElementById(funFactsJsIds[index]).innerText;
} else {
    funFactContainer.innerText = funFacts[index - funFactsJsIds.length];
}


In this way, you don't have to keep the index == 0 || index == 1 which is very fragile when you add more js in the future.

/steven-solar/step/pull/1#pullrequestreview-416440822,2020-05-21T19:47:05Z,geoffbass,"Nice work, Steven! I added some comments with a few suggestions but once you address them feel free to merge this without another round of review. You can certainly reach out to me for clarification or with follow-up questions though."
/steven-solar/step/pull/1#discussion_r428875103,2020-05-21T19:47:05Z,geoffbass,"nit: Indentation here is 4 spaces instead of 2 as in most of the rest of the file. Google's style guide uses 2. You can un-indent the div.content too to make it clear it's a sibling of the img. Same applies to a few other instances in the file below.

In my opinion the best way to deal with code formatting is to automate it. I've found [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) great for web dev. I'm not sure if it'll integrate into your current workflow but if you get VS Code working there's a Prettier plug-in you can use to format on save, really nice for freeing up all your attention for solving the problem at hand without overhead like formatting to distract you."
/steven-solar/step/pull/1#discussion_r428876359,2020-05-21T19:49:31Z,geoffbass,`height` and `width` should probably be handled by CSS. You can add the same class to all these logo images.
/steven-solar/step/pull/1#discussion_r428877158,2020-05-21T19:51:04Z,geoffbass,"Nice use of classes on these, really helps not just with writing style rules but with making the markup here semantic and understandable."
/steven-solar/step/pull/1#discussion_r428879794,2020-05-21T19:56:12Z,geoffbass,"This rule is used a few times in this stylesheet. Consider adding another class to specify the font of text elements and keeping the style rule in one place. That'll make it a lot easier if you decide to change the font at some point.

Ideally stuff like this would be handled with a variable/constant, but unfortunately CSS doesn't really offer great options for this at the moment, as far as I know. Feel free to look into SCSS if you're interested in adding variables, loops, mixins, etc. to your stylesheets."

I was thinking that you had the delete button inside the `if (comments.length > 0)` block so that you would only be showing the delete button when there are a non-zero number of comments.

I ran into the issue where if a user asked to see say 5 comments, but then changed that number to 0, the delete button would still show (even though no comments were showing). I realized this was because I was defining and clearing the button div within the conditional. That's why I moved it up, but if there is a better solution I would be happy to adapt."

/steven-solar/step/pull/12#discussion_r433903213,2020-06-02T14:05:33Z,VivekShankar,"Here and below - when passing literal parameters, adding a comment like /* parameterName= */ can make the code more readable. 

Here's a snippet from the Java Style Guide: 


In certain contexts literal arguments - such as 0, """", true and false, or null - can make it difficult for readers to know what a method will do. We generally discourage defining methods that take boolean parameters or otherwise expect users to pass in ambiguous literals. However, when you must call such a method you're encouraged to use the parameter name as an inline comment at the call site, so that readers don't need to look at the method declaration to understand the parameter's purpose.

Such a comment should be formatted in this way:

`booleanMethod(/* enableFoo= */ true);`"

/steven-solar/step/pull/13#discussion_r434552658,2020-06-03T13:08:23Z,geoffbass,I'd recommend putting these in an event listener for something like [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event) in your script to separate content from behavior (https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Separation_of_Concerns);

Didn’t realize that this violated separation of concerns (assumed it was equivalent to giving a css class to html element). But this makes sense and would be cleaner (especially with calling multiple functions). 

Did some reading into different handlers I could use for this and it seems the one you recommended, DOMContentLoaded, is better than others. I considered using the window.onload attribute, but read that this only fires once everything is loaded (dom, css, external images, etc) whereas DOMContentLoaded will fire as soon as the dom tree is ready, which in this case I think is better practice. Not sure how much it matters as there's minimal content to load anyways, but thought I'd share what I found.

/steven-solar/step/pull/14#discussion_r435579588,2020-06-04T22:07:53Z,geoffbass,The JavaScript style guide enforces [braces for all control structures](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-braces-all). This does meet the condition for putting it all on one line if you think that improves readability. I personally always use the braces though.

I think gson does sanitization but it's good practice to avoid it. `innerText` is generally safer.

I'd recommend using the DOM API to create these spans (specifically [`document.createElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and then set their innerText, then append the new elements to the div container. I'm happy to provide more guidance on this if you have questions or get stuck."

In case you're interested... the arrange step is for setting up details of the external world specific to the situation under test (e.g. in this case, initializing the `Greeter`). 

The act step is where you actually make calls to the class/object under test .

The assert step is the place to make assertions on the return values collected.

We usually leave a blank line in between the arrange, act, and test steps - which you've already done! "

Could you share a link to the live page so we can see the rendered page? You can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/shivanighanta/my-portfolio/blob/master/walkthroughs/week-2-web-development/portfolio-walkthrough.md#live-server), or alternatively attach a screenshot.

A few more comments:
  - Your PR description is excellent: it is detailed without being too extensive (which is good) and we can immediately know what was changed from reading it.
  - The title could be a bit more descriptive. In the current state, reading the PR title isn't enough to understand what the PR addresses (which functionality is being added?). This is important, because people search for PRs / commits by looking at the first line / title, and not the description. My recommendation is to have a title that's a good descriptive 1-line description of the PR, and take advantage of the description to fill in any extra info relevant to the change."

While it's great to have incremental changes / PRs, it's typically preferred for each change to be functional to some extent. For example, if you have a PR with images that cannot be resolved, it feels like there is a bug in the implementation to the reviewer.

What I would suggest is removing the images tags from the page for now, and add them back when the images are added. Alternatively, you can add the missing images to this PR. What do you think?"

A good rule of thumb, is to consider your code as if someone else was reading it, and then ask yourself, ""could a programmer a little below my level understand what's happening here?"". if the answer is no, first see if you can make your code more clear. if that doesn't help, then consider a comment.

to apply that to the comment here:
""execute the function"" - it should be obvious to another programmer that this is executing a function, so this part of the comment is not helpful
""show all columns"" - is this obvious? perhaps... but i would say it could be made more obvious by renaming the argument of filterSelection(...). ""c"" is not a descriptive name below, but ""columns"" or something like that might be. if you rename this to columns, then a reader can look at filterSelection, and it becomes obvious this is filtering comments - and then they have understood everything that's in the comment, and it becomes no longer necessary."

generally when writing code we want to avoid unnecessary branching - branching is harder code to read and understand because now your reader has to keep more possibilities in their head, one for each branch of the if statement. many times branching is good of course - but if it's possible to trivially eliminate branches then that is generally preferred."

The reason to spreading commits to more self-contained units is (1) easier to review and spot an error and (2) if something needs to be reverted for some reason, we can just revert the relevant parts."

Is this close to what you had in mind? Without waiting for the promise from response.text(), my header was only showing up as [HeaderObject] on the page.

Also, quick tip: When clicking the + sign to add a comment, you can also drag it to specifically comment on multiple lines of code."

It seemed like in your first .then statement, you were calling 'response.text()' function and then passing that to a subsequent then block.

You should be able to do something like the following:

 .then(response => {
     const text = response.text();
     let footer = document.createElement(""footer"");
    footer.innerHTML = text;
    document.querySelector(""body"").after(footer);

I also used GitHub's suggestion functionality to fix a typo -- mainly to show that this functionality, while useful, can throw a wrench into a habitual git workflow. If you accept a suggestion, github will commit the change. If you then modify the same file locally and try to commit & push, you may find a conflict!

I'd favor the latter because HTTP handlers should be _stateless_ -- they should behave the same way for each identical request.

One thing to pay attention to is opportunities to reduce code duplication. For example, you have `BlogCommentsService` and a `CommentsService`. They are very similar. You can potentially replace them with a single `CommentsService`. However, this will only be possible if you make your `Comment` entity more rich with an additional attribute that would specify whether it is for the blog or the regular comments page. Then you can filter on that `type` attribute, depending on which page is using the comments. I hope this makes sense.

Putting all of these magic strings in one place makes it easier for you to verify that the parameters as defined in your HTML match the server parameter names.

For example:

```
private static final String NAME_QUERY_PARAM = ""name-input"";

/anfee1/step2/pull/5#discussion_r436141241,2020-06-05T20:09:11Z,bsidhom,"It's great to define anonymous, in-line functions like this where it aids readability. When you do so, please use multi-line block syntax where doing so makes sense.

For example, this would be easier to read as:

```
var validateComments = commentPackage.flatMap(comment => validateComment(
    comment,
    x => [x],
    x => {
        console.log('Invalid comment ', x);
        return [];
    }));
```

However, it would be even clearer than that to use an explicit `filter` rather than a `flatMap` (since you're not actually transforming the values here, but just passing them through directly via `x => [x]`:

```
let validComments = commentPackage.filter(comment => {
    if (comment.name === """" || comment.payload === """") {
        console.log(""Invalid comment "", comment);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
});
validComments.map(formatComment)...;
```

In fact, if you do validation in the server and trust the output, you theoretically shouldn't even need to filter comments this way. Doing so is a trade-off, but it might make sense to add validation to the server now since you'll be storing data in Datastore later and you most likely don't want to persist invalid comments."

I still think client side validation is important so errors are explicitly handled instead of silent failures when something is wrong. I agree that switching validateComment to a boolean and filtering/unzipping might be nice, but I was just trying to show some javascripty ways to do things, which sometimes involves using callbacks like this."

That is mostly for the sake of incremental improvement though. I'd like you to keep improving the structure of your code little by little in small, independent reviews.

That can probably start with something as simple as improving the formatting of the comment list by generating structured list elements instead of the newline-centric printing into the paragraph.

Since this appears to be the only stateful member accessed, the easiest way to do this is to use `movieVotes` itself a as the lock. Basically, all access to `movieVotes` (whether reading or writing that variable or its underlying storage) should be done within a synchronized block as follows:

```java
synchronized (movieVotes) {
  // Use `movieVotes` here...
}
```

If you use this approach, make sure that the `movieVotes` member is `final`.

Alternatively, you could switch to a `ConcurrentHashMap` if you use the single-statement `merge` call as described above."

/anfee1/step2/pull/6#discussion_r437766656,2020-06-09T22:56:04Z,bsidhom,"You can remove `movieVotes.put` now that you're using `movieVotes.merge`.

Here's an overview of the relevant `Map` methods, which I think make the semantics of `merge` clearer:
* `get(key)`: Retrieves the value for the given key, if any
* `getOrDefault(key, default)`: Retrieves the value for the given key if it exists. Otherwise, returns the default value. Does not update the map. (I would have recommended using this method if you were not updating the map immediately afterward.)
* `put(key, value)`: Modifies the map in-place by setting the given key to the given value. Returns the value _previously_ associated with the given key (or null). (You obviously don't need to use the return value here since you're just modifying the map and not reading anything back.)
* `[merge(key, value, remappingFunction)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#merge-K-V-java.util.function.BiFunction-)`: Sets the given `key` to the given `value` if there's no value already associated. If there is already an associated value, then `remappingFunction` is called with the old value and new value as arguments; the key is associated with the return value of `remappingFunction`. In the case of `ConcurrentHashMap`.

In the case of `ConcurrentHashMap`, the entire `merge` operation happens atomically. In other words, it allows you to to retrieve an old map value and update the map using a computation over the old value all in one step, while maintaining thread-safety. Since you don't use this result to perform other updates that need to happen synchronously, it's safe to use a single `merge` operation here instead of synchronizing over multiple update operations.

Setting `movieVotes.put(animatedMovie, numVotes)` is not technically incorrect in the context of this specific thread, since it just re-sets `animatedMovie` to point to `numVotes` (which it already should have after the call to `merge`). Unfortunately, this opens up the code to bad interleavings ([race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition)) which might introduce errors.

For example, suppose that 2 different users are adding a vote for ""Shrek"" at the same time, from different computers. Say that, before either of these users votes, `numVotes` for ""Shrek"" is 1. Now the first user's request comes in, and `movieVotes.merge()` runs successfully and the value of ""Shrek"" (number of votes) is 2. Now suppose that the second user's vote request comes in and also runs `merge`, meaning that the value is now 3. However, suppose that the second user's request thread executes `movieVotes.put()` next. This re-sets the count of Shrek to 3, which it already was, so no problem yet. Finally, the first thread continues executing `movieVotes.put()` (suppose that the thread was sleeping during this time). Recall that the first thread had originally set the vote count to 2, which means that `numVotes` is currently 2. The call to `movieVotes.put()` runs successfully and the count for ""Shrek"" is now 2 again! We started with a count of 1, processed two vote requests (""successfully"") and ended with a count of 2--one of the votes was effectively dropped."

I'd actually suggest that you don't need the custom tags you've made, particularly `intro-title` and `cursive`. Some reasons: 1) in your case, it's simple and direct to just style `h1` and `h2` in your CSS. `h1` already suggests that it's a top-level heading like a title, so having the extra tag to describe it may not be too useful. 2) Regarding the `cursive` tag, usually it's a good idea not to have anything in your HTML that suggests visual appearance, that way you can choose to change that appearance in the future (let's say by un-cursiving the text) by just updating one CSS rule, and you don't have to go through and change every instance you've added `cursive` in the HTML."

- fetch a fixed/max amount of items from the database. [See](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/PreparedQuery.html#countentities). This will increase the efficiency a lot without keeping a counter inside the iteration. For example, if the database has 1K items and you just need 10 of them. A full lookup of 1000 items will cost 100 times more than a look up with 10 items back, and you don't have to count yourself afterwords.
Here is an example:
```
import com.google.appengine.api.datastore.FetchOptions;

 Cursor cursor = ...

 ...

 // limit 10
 datastoreService.prepare(query).asList(FetchOptions.Builder.withLimit(10));

 // limit 10, start cursor
 datastoreService.prepare(query).asList(FetchOptions.Builder.withLimit(10).startCursor(cursor));
 ```
- get the result as a list but not only iterable, and there are other options as well. [See](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/PreparedQuery#aslist).

> Each test should explicitly name not only the method being tested, but also the expected outcome and sometimes specific details of the state or input being tested.

For example, I would name these last 2 tests `query_onlyOptionalAttendees_returnsAvailableTime` `query_onlyOptionalAttendeesWithNoAvailableTime_returnsNoTimes`.
No need to change since you're just following existing convention in the code you're modifying.

Here's an external guide I found. https://qualitycoding.org/unit-test-naming/
The most important thing is the expected result and the condition of the test. When someone else makes changes to your code, if you didn't state the expected result, they can end up modifying your test *just to make the test pass* but the test may not be testing what it's meant to.

One thing I would recommend to keep going is to move all database logic to the query helper. Imagine a query helper that returns a list of `Comment` (an object that doesn't exist yet) and has a method for deleting a `Comment`! In this case, the servlets no longer need to know anything about the datastore including the property names!"
/sasymer/step/pull/4#discussion_r437532270,2020-06-09T15:43:25Z,gagomez,Nice use of constants!
/sasymer/step/pull/4#discussion_r437539512,2020-06-09T15:52:47Z,gagomez,"It is usually much cleaner to use the Java time constructs (e.g. Instant, Duration) to deal with time (there are some gotchas but can make code much easier to understand). For example, in line 83 above it is unclear what the unit of time `submitTime` uses. Consider this example instead:

```
Instant commentTime = Instant.ofEpochMilli((Long) entity.getProperty(TIMESTAMP));
Duration ageOfComment = Duration.between(commentTime, Instant.now());
Long minutes = ageOfComment.toMinutes();

This has the added bonus of getting rid of the need for MILL_DIVISOR and SECOND_DIVISOR :)"

From an API perspective, it's difficult to convey that a constructor is executing a query so it could lead to mis-usages (e.g. creating a QueryHelper but then not using the results).

In general, I avoid doing any work in a constructor outside of setting fields. You can do this work when `getResults` and `deleteAllEntries` is called. Feel free to put this in a helper method."

Note that creating a CommentQueryHelper specific to comments can be refactored later to be flexible if the API it exposes is flexible (e.g. having methods like getResults(), deleteEntity(), addEntity())."

To clarify about CommentList, it was intended to be a wrapper class to make it easy to turn a sorted list of comments and along with the total number of comments into a json. The total number of comments was included such that only the sublist of comments needed by the page had to be sent to allow for the javascript to list the accurate number of pages.

Adding the wildcard or a specific type just makes it type safe which probably doesn't matter in this case since you aren't really adding anything to it but instead reading from it. "

I looked at the nested class documentation (which is why I changed it from ""return new AutoValue_Comment"" to ""return new AutoValue_DataServlet_Comment"").  I've also tried making create non-static (also didn't work because nonstatic method can't be accessed in a static context, which was expected). I don't think I should make DataServlet static.

-  `gson.toJson(null)` returns ""null"" (as a string), so the response is ""null"". `resp.json()` in the client see this and parse it as null.

/kpancha/step/pull/17#discussion_r434114672,2020-06-02T19:08:44Z,jesseelizabeth,All of these fields should be camelCase. Caps are used for static final variables:  https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.4-constant-names

/kpancha/step/pull/18#discussion_r434141729,2020-06-02T19:58:56Z,kpancha,yep it looks like one instance for the servlet is sufficient

In the first case, there will always be a comment and a name parameter in the req body (though either could be an empty string), hence why we check for content and name != null in the first if statement (adding a new comment). In the latter case, the key is always passed in the request body so this is how we know it is a ""like"".

Essentially you have a logger instance per class type: 
private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(DataServlet.class.getName()); 

so then there are different ""levels"" of logging  - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html because sometimes we just need informational logging vs when exceptions happen so maybe Id put this as warning level 
logger.log(Level.WARNING, ""Entity was not found in the datastore: "" + e.getMessage())

We want to use standard frameworks for these types of things as opposed to printlns because on a larger scale when lots of different kinds of things are logged (for info or warning or error purposes - standardisation enables users to filter the logs when they need to look at what happened easily:)) "

Something that could help is the meta tag for the viewport, so that your site maps correctly when viewed in a mobile device.

/savsa/step/pull/2#discussion_r432752558,2020-05-29T21:45:44Z,savsa,I'm using `+=` so it's appending it to the end of the `#comments` element. Pressing the button twice appends the comments twice and you can see both afterwards.

/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r434198916,2020-06-02T21:59:21Z,wli,"1. `comment == """"` is a java gotcha. This will always be false because java is doing reference comparison here, and not a string value comparison. This should be `comment.isEmpty()` instead.
2. Once you do change point 1 above, you will then need to do the nullcheck first because you don't want a null pointer exception."
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r434200633,2020-06-02T22:03:30Z,wli,"Unfortunately this is a somewhat dangerous security pattern, as `comment` might have special characters inside (`<`, `""`, etc). Instead, you should use the `.innerText` property to safely set the value."
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r434760003,2020-06-03T18:10:12Z,savsa,"It will send """" in the request but in the servlet it checks for null or empty string on the sent parameter and won't store that comment and therefore that comment will never get sent to the frontend and printed out."
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r434765561,2020-06-03T18:20:15Z,savsa,Changed to using createElement() along with .innerText to be safer.
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r435480506,2020-06-04T18:52:30Z,wli,i think you need: `response.setStatus(SC_BAD_REQUEST)` too. HTTP error codes are an important part of building an API.
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r435480852,2020-06-04T18:53:07Z,wli,i think this could go inside of the `</body>` tag
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r435481725,2020-06-04T18:54:47Z,wli,should you `return;` if there is an error?
/savsa/step/pull/3#discussion_r435482854,2020-06-04T18:56:51Z,wli,"since you repeat this block of code above (line 28), this would be cleaner if you created a new function:

```
function appendComment(value) {

  liComment.innerText = value;
  liComment.className = 'comment';
  commentContainer.append(liComment);

/AniMachaidze/step/pull/1#discussion_r431128656,2020-05-27T13:25:58Z,astrelni,I think `id` is more appropriate than `class` here and in the other html files since the navigation is unique for each web page.

/AniMachaidze/step/pull/9#discussion_r434546987,2020-06-03T12:59:12Z,astrelni,I think it may be more appropriate for the default value here to be an empty string. Then you can actually set the default value below as an integer and not call `parseInt` if the string is empty.
/AniMachaidze/step/pull/9#discussion_r434548730,2020-06-03T13:02:01Z,astrelni,I think a better name for this variable would be something like `maxNumComments`. Something that shows that we will only display this number of comments if we don't run out of them first.
/AniMachaidze/step/pull/9#discussion_r434549013,2020-06-03T13:02:28Z,astrelni,I think it is a good idea to document the default number of `5`.

Like for the other cases you also need to make sure the selected_square is not the same as the current square, though.

Would anything have been wrong with 
`((square.row == (this.selected_square.row + 1) || square.row == (this.selected_square.row - 1)) && ( square.col == (this.selected_square.col + 1) || square.col == (this.selected_square.col - 1)))` ?

Also I would probably wrap the math on the right side of the equation with parentheses. Order of operation works correctly in this case, but just to be safe. I used to work using a language where everything was left to right. Absolutely no order of operation rules so now I guess I'm paranoid."

Like if you made the `new Gson()` a class property like `game` and just reused it for. each request.
/nlumiere/step_portfolio/pull/3#discussion_r434820105,2020-06-03T19:59:57Z,aokeke,This can also be handled from the UI side with a refresh of the UI elements that are relevant after receiving a response.

I think, in general, you should try to avoid. Creating HTML in the JS if it isn't required. It might make it harder for other developers to find where the HTML is to make fixes. Also it is easier to make errors when it is wrapped in a string because linters will ignore them."

1. Unclear what div refers to.  It's the number of degrees between satellite centroids, right?  Someone reading your code isn't going to be able to glean that from div, so they'll have to look at the RHS of the assignment to understand what this variable actually does, and then recall that every time they see it reappear in the code.
2. More importantly, in this specific case, people are going to see this variable name and think it has something to do with a \<div\> element, which could lead to confusion if it gets used in an ambiguous context later on."

In general, imagine you're going to have to come back in six months to fix a bug in this code and want to be able to understand everything as fast as possible.  If you just see ""numb"", and don't remember what it means, you are going to have to parse the RHS of the assignment to understand what ""numb"" is supposed to be.

For instance it is 150px x 150px but after you've positioned elements absolutely within it it takes up a lot more space, meaning the box model does not accurately represent its contents on the page.

Instead consider creating one div to contain all 7 of your elements, centering it vertically+horizontally on the page using flexbox, and dynamically positioning all 7 elements inside it."

Hypothetical example of why this would matter:  Your display is wrong, and another engineer comes in and tries to figure out why.  They know it must be something modifying the pixels, but as they're skimming your code they see ""convertCoordinateToString"" and think ""ok I don't need to read that function because all it's doing is converting this to a string.

You could make it more flexible, and also easier to follow and understand, by reorganizing some of your code into classes.

For instance you could have one class that creates the actual icon element itself, and another that does the math to position it within the parent div.  Something like

const iconGenerator = new IconGenerator(width, height);
const icons = [];
for (const iconName of [""icon1"", ""icon2"", ""icon3""]) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;icons.push(IconGenerator.generate(iconName));

const iconInjector = new IconInjector(parentDiv, icons.length);

When you find yourself returning multiple values from a method, and the relationship between the values is that they're all part of the same thing, that's often a sign that you actually want to represent that data with a POJO (Plain Old Java Object -- just a set of properties with getters/setters).

Alternatively, break it up into multiple method calls via one parameterized method:

private static final String EMAIL_KEY = ""email""

String email = myMethod(EMAIL_KEY)

myMethod(String key) {

Thanksgiving 2017 I spent several days investigating a bug that, at the end of the day, was someone using a custom job to make requests to our server (probably some kind of scraper).  After we made some changes, their request was malformed, which our code didn't expect, and the default error handling behavior was to redirect.

I think the size of this PR was OK. README change could have gone in a separate PR, but it doesn't practically matter.

Another option is to squash your commits when creating a pull request, so they don't show up as individual entries on the 'master' branch: https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits

Assuming the `asIterable` call above properly returns no more than `numOfComments` number of comments, then `commentList` has the right number of comments. If, in the case you don't trust `asIterable` to return the right number of comments with the limit you have imposed, i.e. `commentList.size() > numOfComments`, then this if check is testing the incorrect condition.

/jeward414/my-portfolio/pull/9#discussion_r437799356,2020-06-10T00:47:49Z,sperzion,"Isn't `numOfComments` supposed to be the number of comments the user is asking to see? Usually, that means at most that many comments at a time.

What this if check is doing is increasing the number of comments returned to the front end to the full number of comments.

As an example, say `numOfComments` as entered by the user is 5. Say you have stored 100 comments. This if statement would cause `numOfComments` to be 100."

Back when I was web developing, promises were the hot thing, and it was a huge improvement to callbacks. The reason being is that callbacks made code super hard to read since it required tons of nested functions.

/SabrinaSnider/my-portfolio/pull/6#discussion_r435953455,2020-06-05T14:18:31Z,brucezheng,"Nit: You can use block-like indentation (+2 on contents) for object literals ```{a, b, ...}``` and array literals ```[a, b, ...]```, but not function parameters ```(a, b, ...)```. For function parameters, you should follow normal line wrapping rules which is at least +4 on continuation lines from the original line ([documentation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#formatting-indent)).

So, here for example, these would be valid ways to wrap:
```
gsap.fromTo('.circle-small',

    {x: '0', opacity: 1, ease:'back.out(1.7)', delay: 1.3});

This is not the only way to solve this problem though. What you could do is have the second argument of ```fadeButton``` just be an object containing a bunch of options. Although at that point ```fadeButton``` is kind of just a pointless wrapper for ```gsap.to```. Another option is when you declare constants for colors, you could declare constants for functional names instead of descriptive names, that is, you could define
```
const PORTFOLIO_BUTTON_HOVER_TEXT_COLOR = '#ede7f6';

```

```
.dot {
  /* Display */
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 130px;
  width: 130px;
  margin: 10px;
  /* Layout */

  /* Content */
  background-color: #9f8cb3;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

I don't know what the good names for the sections, like ```Display```, ```Layout```, ```Content``` would be. Typically having a super large list for properties is solved by other means like using a system that compiles CSS from a higher level language (there are a lot of tools that do this, if this is something else you're interested in exploring.

Did you choose to implement this recursively because of setTimeout? The recursive element of this makes it a lot more difficult to follow.

I investigated this and found a possible workaround using ```async```/```await``` and promises: https://jsfiddle.net/01kgpeqt/

You use a ```sleep``` helper function that returns a promise and then ```await``` on that sleep function so you can write this kind of stuff iteratively."

```
[1] >Hi, my name is <span style=""color: #9366e3; font-weight: bold;"">S</span>
[2] >Hi, my name is <span style=""color: #9366e3; font-weight: bold;"">Sa</span>

This is a really interesting micro implementation problem to solve - and a good candidate for creating a js library or something (which I bet exist already). We should make sure that the strategy we end up using here doesn't solve for a much ""bigger"" problem than necessary - the algorithm that could take any number of nested ```<span>``` tags requires creating a parse tree for ```text``` I think."

1. Seperated getComments() into two methods: getComments() which fetches comments from the server, and displayComments() which displays them on the front-end. This change was mostly for readability.
2. Combined the IsAdminServlet and GetUserServlet into one servlet called GetUserData. This returns both the email of the current user and the admin status. Since these values are usually used together, I figured it would be more efficient.

Yea, I noticed that too. For some reason it didn't happen on my other PR.

Edit: After googling it, it looks like PRs don't keep track of changes to the target branch. Perhaps a work-around next time is to make a ""Image Upload"" branch, then from there branch off into front end or back end branches."

/zyelcrier/step/pull/17#discussion_r437595606,2020-06-09T17:22:40Z,ljfranklin,Nit: preference for adding/removing a `.hide` class rather than directly changing the inline style. This gives more flexibility to dynamically hide other elements on the page and makes it easier to tell what is initially hidden by reading the HTML.
/zyelcrier/step/pull/17#discussion_r437597493,2020-06-09T17:25:57Z,ljfranklin,Doing a string contains on the response is pretty brittle (likely to accidentally break). Instead use `response.sendError` on the server-side to return a status of 401 Unauthorized if the user isn't logged in. Then you can check `response.status` in the JS rather than doing a string contains.
/zyelcrier/step/pull/17#discussion_r437597931,2020-06-09T17:26:39Z,ljfranklin,Your server is returning HTML snippets but you're not displaying them anywhere. Add the server response to the page so the user gets a login link.

/zyelcrier/step/pull/18#discussion_r438341585,2020-06-10T18:55:09Z,ljfranklin,Did you test this? The previous code make it look like `getCurrentUser()` would return null which this change still doesn't handle.

when I  changed it to if (userService.isUserLoggedIn())  it didnt work it would send  the error message anyway @ljfranklin "
/zyelcrier/step/pull/18#discussion_r438367294,2020-06-10T19:45:08Z,ljfranklin,The docs say `getCurrentUser()` returns `null` if the user isn't logged in: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/users/UserService#getcurrentuser. Your current code will still fail with a null pointer in the logged out case.

f, fixup = like ""squash"", but discard this commit's log message
x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
d, drop = remove commit

These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.

If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.

However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

I'm assuming I rebased and aborted too many times. 
Should I try this: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/squash_and_merge.html?

git rebase -i 

Will automatically show you the list of all the commits since head that have yet to be pushed.

(-i means interactive mode)

You can then change the keywords in front of them to squash everything except for the most recent commit, then change the commit message to something that encapsulates what is now in the new commit.

I see from looking at the [API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/FetchOptions.html#limit) that the limit must be non-negative, but if we can't parse the number it might make sense to return no comments instead of 1.

/eldrickb/step/pull/6#issuecomment-641034018,2020-06-09T05:17:01Z,mmallett,"> Why do both keys and IDs exist?

```
Each entity in a Datastore mode database has a key that uniquely identifies it. The key consists of the following components:

The namespace of the entity, which allows for multitenancy
The kind of the entity, which categorizes it for the purpose of queries
An identifier for the individual entity, which can be either
a key name string
an integer numeric ID
An optional ancestor path locating the entity within the database hierarchy
```
https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/entities#key

A more generic answer, not specific to DataStore:

In most databases, you have a **primary key** which uniquely identifies each entity in the table. This is usually an increasing `long int` or a UUID. So the ID is both an ID and a Key, it's the primary key.

But you don't always know the primary key, and have some information about the entity and want to find it by that information. You can create other keys that the table is indexed on to speed up queries. Say you need to query comments created by a specific user, you could create a key for the comment user in addition to the primary key for that entity."

The code could be easier to follow and maintain if you divide out the concerns into their own file, and only expose an API for an index or controller script to call.

/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/3#discussion_r435445159,2020-06-04T17:58:43Z,jayspringfield,"Since you aren't using the function, it's best to remove it."
/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/3#discussion_r435447763,2020-06-04T18:03:20Z,PhillipsOlagunju,"I will make sure to do that, thanks

The code change seems reasonable though, so I think it's fine to merge assuming you've tested it.

/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/5#discussion_r435930552,2020-06-05T13:44:43Z,mariabajzek,"In this case I would make your DatastoreService object a member of your DataServlet class (like you have with comments and gson) and then you can refer to it in doGet().

As far as I can tell, the construction of the DatastoreService doesn't depend on anything in the specific request and response, and it will be less expensive to just create it once and reuse it.

This is good to keep in mind in general when you have an object that might be slow or expensive to create."
/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/5#discussion_r435943517,2020-06-05T14:02:32Z,mariabajzek,"A note about Java: Casting can be somewhat risky. In this case, [getProperty()](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/datastore/PropertyContainer.html#getproperty) is only guaranteed to return an Object. In this specific case, you know that the ""comment"" property will be an Object that is a String but you can imagine in a more complex application you might not be able to guarantee that. Maybe it would return a more general Object that can't be cast to a String.

One thing you can do to be sure it's safe to cast is to use the instanceof operator. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7313559/what-is-the-instanceof-operator-used-for-in-java) is a good explanation of that.

I know there is some controversy over the use of instanceof, but I'm not aware of a better way to handle that situation. Also, I think your code should be fine here, I just wanted to make you aware of this (and you can add instanceof if you want to practice it)."

(This isn't a request for a change, just something to think about)."

/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/5#discussion_r436077188,2020-06-05T17:58:22Z,mariabajzek,"This is an ok way to handle this. You might want to consider adding an ""else"" here to specifically handle the case where you can't cast the comment to a string. Some reasonable behaviors I can think of are:

1. Set comment to something like ""This comment cannot be loaded."" This way it will be clear to a user (or to you, for debugging) that there was an issue with loading and someone didn't just submit an empty comment.

1. You could treat it as a real error and throw an exception. In this case you probably don't need to do that since you probably still want to try to load the rest of the page, but this is an option in general."

/PhillipsOlagunju/step/pull/5#discussion_r436967167,2020-06-08T20:02:12Z,mariabajzek,One tip for this is to include the value you couldn't convert in this error message. It'll make it easier to debug if that happens.

Whichever seems more readable to you is fine. A positive about doing it the way you have it here is that the variable name acts like a comment telling you what the URL is for.

String logoutUrl = userService.createLogoutURL(""/index.html"");"
